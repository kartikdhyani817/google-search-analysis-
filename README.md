This project focuses on analyzing global interest in the keyword "Artificial Intelligence" using Google Trends data. It simulates a data-driven role where insights are derived from real-world search behavior across time and geography.

Dynamic Keyword Analysis

Developed a Python script where changing just one keyword allows dynamic retrieval and analysis of trend data (can be extended to any term).

Top 15 Countries Visualization

Identified and visualized the top 15 countries where the keyword Artificial Intelligence is searched the most.

Created bar charts for easier comparison.

World Map Representation 

Plotted a choropleth map using Plotly Express to visually represent global interest.

Countries with higher interest were shaded darker, enabling quick insights.

Time-wise Interest Trend 

Extracted time-series data showing how interest in Artificial Intelligence has evolved over the past years.

Built line graphs showing weekly/monthly interest trends.

Keyword Comparison Graph 

Compared Artificial Intelligence with related terms (e.g., Machine Learning, Deep Learning) using multi-line plots.

Visualized how interest in these technologies compares over time.
